\charterchapter{Aragon Governance Proposal Process}
\label{chap:AGPProcess}

The purpose of the \acf{AGP} process is to provide a structured process for making changes to the shared resources of the \gls{AragonNetwork}.
For these shared resources, governance processes are needed to grant or deny access and approve or reject proposed changes.

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\sectionitem{Governance Bodies}
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item The following bodies will form part of the \ac{AGP} process and are collectively referred to as the \gls{AragonNetworkDAO}, composed of a Main \ac{DAO} and Sub-\acp{DAO}.
		\item \textbf{Main \ac{DAO}:} an Aragon Govern \ac{DAO} that uses \gls{AragonVoice} voting to validate the community’s sentiment and then scheduling for on-chain execution on Govern, enabling \glspl{ANTHolder} to both exercise direct democracy (directly propose and approve proposals of any kind) and elect members to existing or new Sub-\acp{DAO}.
		\item \textbf{Sub-\acp{DAO}:} \acp{DAO} controlled by the Main \ac{DAO}.
		At launch, the following Sub-\acp{DAO} will exist:
		\begin{enumerate}
			
			\item \textbf{Executive Sub-\ac{DAO}:} an Aragon Govern \ac{DAO}, with permission for treasury management of the Operations Vault.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The Executive Committee \ac{DAO} is governed on a do-ocracy basis (Optimistic Governance) by the Executive Committee Members.
				\item Members of the Executive \ac{DAO} (``Executive Committee Members'') are elected by \glspl{ANTHolder} through a vote on the Main \ac{DAO}.
			\end{enumerate}
		
			\item \textbf{Compliance Sub-\ac{DAO}:} an Aragon Govern \ac{DAO}, with permission to veto proposals and actions in the Main \ac{DAO} and Sub-\acp{DAO} that represent a breach of this Charter and/or directly harm the \gls{AragonNetwork}.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The above shall not include actions or proposals to add and/or remove wallet addresses from the Compliance \ac{DAO}.
				\item The compliance \ac{DAO} is governed on a do-ocracy basis (Optimistic Governance) by the Compliance Committee Members.
				\item Members of the Compliance \ac{DAO} (``Compliance Committee Members'' i.e. wallets with permission to veto proposals through the Compliance \ac{DAO}) are elected by \glspl{ANTHolder} through a vote on the Main \ac{DAO}.
			\end{enumerate}
			
			\item \textbf{Tech Committee:} an off-chain committee charged with deploying accepted proposals that contain new code (and managing the access to the necessary Web2 platforms to perform this task).
			The Tech Committee also has the authority to remove proposals that do not meet technical quality standards as well as to determine which proposals should be subject to a 3rd party independent technology audit.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item The Tech Committee decides on the need (or lack thereof) for audits on proposals using \gls{AragonVoice} and a majority vote.
				\item Members of the Tech \ac{DAO} (``Tech Committee Members'') are elected by \glspl{ANTHolder} through a vote on the Main \ac{DAO}.
			\end{enumerate}
		
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Aragon Court:} Used to challenge the actions scheduled on both the Main \ac{DAO} and any Sub-\ac{DAO}, and directly from the Voice UI / or the custom UI for AN \ac{DAO}.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\sectionitem{Separation of Powers}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The same members shall not be part of more than one of the following: the Executive Sub-\ac{DAO}, Compliance Sub-\ac{DAO}, Tech Committee, and \glspl{Guardian} in \gls{AragonCourt} mainnet.
		\item When a decentralised identity solution is integrated into the \ac{DAO}, members of these committees shall prove their unique identity using said solution.
	\end{enumerate}

	\sectionitem{Formation of new Sub-DAOs}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The Main \ac{DAO} can deploy a new Sub-\ac{DAO}, be given control over an already deployed \ac{DAO}, dissolve an existing Sub-\ac{DAO}, or spin-off a Sub-\ac{DAO} as an independent \ac{DAO} at any point in time.
		\item Each Sub-\ac{DAO} shall have its own operating agreement outlining at a minimum the responsibilities of its members which shall be listed as an Appendix to the \gls{AragonNetworkCharter}.
		\item In case of conflict between agreements, The \gls{AragonNetworkCharter} shall prevail over any Sub-\ac{DAO} operating agreement.
	\end{enumerate}

	\sectionitem{Treasuries \& Permissions}
	\begin{enumerate}
			
		\item \textbf{Investment Vault:} The reserve treasury of the \gls{AragonNetwork}.
		Used to fund Sub-\acp{DAO} and/or to obtain yield.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Any \ac{ANT} Holder can make proposals for Financial Proposals as described in the Financial Proposals section of this \ac{AGP} process document.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item \textbf{Operations Vault:} The main treasury of the \gls{AragonNetwork}.
		Used to fund operations and make strategic fundings.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Any \ac{ANT} Holder can make proposals for Financial Proposals as
			described in the Financial Proposals section of this \ac{AGP} process
			document.
			\item And any wallet with permissions for the Executive \ac{DAO} (i.e. any member of the Executive \ac{DAO}) can program and delete Financial Actions in the Executive Sub-\ac{DAO} as per the Executive Sub-\ac{DAO} operating agreement.
		\end{enumerate}

		\item \textbf{Additional Treasuries}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Sub-\acp{DAO} are not allowed to create additional treasuries under the exclusive control of the Sub-\ac{DAO} (and outside of the control of the Main \ac{DAO}) unless approved by a majority vote of \glspl{ANTHolder}.
			\item The Main \ac{DAO} may create additional treasuries through a majority vote of \glspl{ANTHolder}.
		\end{enumerate}  
	
	\end{enumerate}

	\sectionitem{Proposals}
	\begin{enumerate}
		
		\item Any \ac{ANTHolder} can create a Proposal in the Main \ac{DAO}.
		\item Any Sub-\ac{DAO} may remove a scheduled proposal at any time (e.g. Veto right) should they have the power to do so as per their operating agreement and as per this Charter.
		\item All proposals must comply with the Requirements for Proposals \& the specific format and process for the type of proposal as follows:

			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Title of Proposal (in the format ``Financial Proposal:[title]'')
				\item Description of the Action
				\item Description of why the author believes it will help to increase the number of Active Aragon \acp{DAO}

				\item  Support: The vote shall be deemed as “passed” with a simple majority (>50\%) of the participating \ac{ANT} having voted in favour.
				\item When a proposal includes a code submission, the Tech Committee has up to 14 days to decide and communicate via a post in Aragon Forum whether a proposal will be:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item Accepted and incorporated.
					\item Submitted to a 3rd party audit to determine its safety (conditional on the Operations Vault having the necessary funds).
					\item Rejected as malicious, technically infeasible, or economically infeasible (if an audit is required and the Operations Vault lacks the necessary funds to cover the costs of the audit).

			\end{enumerate}

			\item \textbf{Approval \& Execution:}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item In the exceptional case that two proposed users gain the same number of votes, the winner will be the candidate who reached the tieing number of votes first.
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item E.g. Candidate A and B both tied at 7 votes, Candidate A wins because it reached 7 votes a day before Candidate B.
